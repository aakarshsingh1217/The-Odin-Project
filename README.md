# The Odin Project
> I pursued the Foundations section of The Odin Project to establish a solid foundation in full-stack web development. This comprehensive curriculum provided me with essential skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies, preparing me for the next step in my learning journey. My goal is to transition seamlessly into the University of Helsinki's "Fullstack Open" course, which focuses on mastering React and modern JavaScript frameworks. By completing the Foundations section of The Odin Project, I aim to build a robust understanding of web development fundamentals, setting the stage for deeper exploration and proficiency in advanced frontend technologies and full-stack development frameworks.

### Other web dev experience
> I learnt the ASP.NET framework at University, along with SQL
